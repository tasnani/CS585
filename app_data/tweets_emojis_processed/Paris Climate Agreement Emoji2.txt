USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM No, alone we can’t. But we wouldn’t be alone. Plenty of countries are willing to work together to combat this, &amp; what do we do? Pull out of the QUERY_TERM and focus on dimming the sun. 
USERNAME_TERM After withdrawal from the QUERY_TERM, a glass dome would be better, so that all the climate gases stays in there and don't pollute the rest of the planet. 
Could not help notice that when asked about wild divergent weather in QLD and NSW and climate change USERNAME_TERM disingenuously said he believes it and muttered ‘Paris agreement’ and...wait for it...supports clean FOSSIL FUELS. Of course no follow up from Fran  #rnbreakfast

-Obamas administration didnt improve climate change 
-Paris agreement is to save face (which I actually read 2 years ago, have you)
