The rhetoric white people use against QUERY_TERM is the same one being used against the 2/3 #Genderrule. When you're privileged, equity to achieve equality feels like oppression. They're really out here acting like it's a women's bill, not a gender bill, men included. 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM I’ve been through those channels and am now working with the department of equity and diversity, along with the QUERY_TERM department. I’ve also been in contact with the deputy superintendent. It’s a slow process, making change.

USERNAME_TERM similar to QUERY_TERM in order to make sure that there isn’t any discrimination...add a reverse discrimination view. Beneficial for someone like me to exceedingly profit under unfair demographic guidelines. Colleges have endorsed diversity by groups, clubs and division 
私：それで共和党に投票しちゃったの？
USERNAME_TERM I’ve had QUERY_TERM pointed out to me as an unfair advantage as a response during a conversation about racial inequality. There are conservatives that believe not only are POC not disadvantaged, but actually systematically advantaged
This is why the DA is hell bent on changing the QUERY_TERM policy, they want to get in as many people in the system because really we’re intimidating them with our qualifications

The south changed to Red with industrialization not racism

USERNAME_TERM White women count! As nation’s foremost sociologists said in early ‘90s, the GREATEST beneficiaries of QUERY_TERM laws, regs &amp; policies = white men.  Their household incomes doubled or tripled bc more white women go college &amp; fare MUCH BETTER than blk career women.

Lmao what are you gonna do in 20 years when you’re the minority? Ask for QUERY_TERM? 
USERNAME_TERM Jobs and promotions should be based on qualifications. QUERY_TERM made women and minorities not try to raise their skill set. They were guaranteed positions due to their gender or ethnicity. Both women and minorities deserve better! IMHO...

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM We have to believe that QUERY_TERM and positive communication will help in discrimination less society.

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM No I did not.  There is no "fact" that QUERY_TERM was "necessary".
