This thread is a nice sum of challenges to labor organizing in higher ed (not just anthro), &amp; yet NTT faculty unions *are* forming &amp; negotiating meaningful contracts, even in right-to-work states like NC where organizing conditions are . It can be done &amp; there are models. URL_TERM

It's inspiring to see QUERY_TERM, student groups, the AFL-CIO, NGOs, media activists, farm and industrial workers, anarchists and others here today in Seattle at the protest. We will not stand for the WTO. #Resist #AntiWTO #SaveOurEnvironment  URL_TERM

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Alan I must disagree with on this one ️ it wasn’t the unions that destroyed this industry, it was the “Lima Declaration 1975” signed by Clyde Cameron of Labor Government with bipartisan support from the Liberal opposition.
USERNAME_TERM I doubt we'll influence Asian countries. We have no smart leaders consistently. In a couple months, we'll be getting electric cars from them. Unions better start spouting realistic jobs and wages, current labor laws don't work.
Labor govern for UNIONS  
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM No, Holden closed because Joe Hockey dared them to closed. I heard him say it in Question Time in Parliament. That had nothing to do with Labor or the Unions. The LNP were in Government at the time. Holden had plans to make 3 more models and stay open until 2022. 
Yes, Labor will do what the unions did to our car Industry.
#HornetFamily in action! We're so proud that our campus QUERY_TERM organized a collection this morning in the Library Quad of some specific items that will help those impacted by the devastating Camp Fire. Thank you for caring, Hornets!  URL_TERM
USERNAME_TERM Indeed ... so Barrie’s now trying to imply the ‘unions’ need to be kept under control by Labor,if they want the win the next Federal election  The reason why #MSM were shocked about the result in Victoria;they have NFI about what is actually happening outside their bubble
USERNAME_TERM  Welp at least now my hometown of Youngstown knows what they HAD TO LOSE by voting trump!
It wasn't enough for republicans to bust the QUERY_TERM to hell, now your flucking jobs are following! 
It’s called priorities the Union way  Unions within Labor's industrial Left faction want Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to commit to a referendum on an indigenous "voice" to parliament in the first term of a Labor government.
USERNAME_TERM With USERNAME_TERM Leadership like this I hope Labor and the Unions whip the arse off the LNP at the upcoming NSW and Federal elections. 

USERNAME_TERM Tariffs.... you mean My Chevy is not American   you mean when the Dems took my Money and bailed out GM the last time, it was a bad investment?  You mean the QUERY_TERM arent orchestrating a larger plan to control the political outlook for 2020 
USERNAME_TERM do you know any other QUERY_TERM? i need to find 3

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM And btw, I get that you’re trying to bait/gotcha me w/ 13th (oh geez, I wonder why), but here’s the catch: that too has legally defined limitations. Penal labor is OK, for example. Also per courts, military draft and discrimination against black unions weren’t covered. OK?
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Labor are economically incompetent &amp; controlled by Unions - we all know this - don't blame me I voted Liberal
USERNAME_TERM lmbo  I just think it's a bit of a 70s-80s throwback to start thinking about mass migration as a way to decimate working class wages, destroy unions or create a labor underclass; globalization did that, what capital wants is for these people to stay put or perish
