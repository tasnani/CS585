Knowing that China is the biggest CO2 emitter on the planet, Trump just did more for the climate with his tariffs and MCA deal than any “green” NGO or over funded government study.

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Donald, you don’t have any economic policies. You don’t even know that Americans pay the tariffs, not China! 
Nicknaming Pres. D. Trump "Pong" just so I can say Ping Pong Match occurring between USA &amp; China. LOL! ROTF.  Personally, I consider Donald's 25% tariff threat as a Bluff. Can't imagine occurring. Maybe 10Ks of workers benefiting from tariffs vs 10s of millions consumers losing

A generation ago, North Carolina was a leading furniture manufacturing state. Today, thanks to USERNAME_TERM and his #MAGA tariffs to discourage furniture imports from China, furniture and the related jobs will move to Vietnam. Brilliant. God help us from this incompetence.

USERNAME_TERM tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers and companies. No money is coming into U.S. coffers from China (or anywhere else) from tariff payments. Zero.  It’s hard to pick on Bernie or Ocasio-Cortez about economic illiteracy when you’re out there taking the cake.
