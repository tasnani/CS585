It brings me great joy to box up at least 100 letters and 100 drawing to send overseas to military personnel who will not be spending the holidays with their families. Thank you USERNAME_TERM for helping with the letters so that we can spread some joy! ️️️ #Thankful #MVWES URL_TERM
USERNAME_TERM I want to back to the days of sending billions to dictators and terrorist regimes as a foreign policy rather than above board, ethical and honest spending to a stated military budget. How many years did Democrats deny raises to military? Ah, those were the good ole days huh? 
USERNAME_TERM Mm... the reason UK and US spending so much on military operations in Middle East is purely out of altruistic desire to promote democracy &amp; environmental issues.  Nothing to do with oil whatsoever. 
DELIVERS ON THE REFERENDUM.
IS GOOD FOR SECURITY AND ORDER WITH A HUGE INCREASE IN QUERY_TERM.
SAVES VASTS AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON COSTLY ELECTIONS.
thank you to all those who are working today instead of spending it with their families, whether that be military, medical, or even just retail ️
USERNAME_TERM  “I know they’re talking about different kinds of sanctions, but they’re spending $110B on military equipment and on things that create jobs, like jobs and others for this country. I don’t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the US.” -Trump, 10/11/18
USERNAME_TERM This is rich coming from a guy who has never served in the military (because of bone spurs ) and is spending his Thanksgiving with his family at a cushy golf club.
Where is president Trump spending #Thanksgiving this year? With our troops overseas? Stateside? Nope. He's at Mar a Lago. He really does love the military. (Photo: Christine Davis) URL_TERM

But... but... the army wants to keep us in a state of perpetual war with India to keep QUERY_TERM up. Don't you see 
Thanks USERNAME_TERM US Military &amp; ICE for keeping our borders safe!
Yes Fantastic  (sarcasm)
BlueDot is veteran-owned so we cannot miss the chance to recognize USERNAME_TERM who support military families around the world spending their holidays in hospitals, fighting for health.  Give to Fisher House and your support will be matched today: URL_TERM
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM That was Trump's " you" to the US for not spending the $20 mil on his military parade. As with all stupid things Trump, he doubled down and got his "parade" anyway...
Obama’s hidden military strategy should shock us all 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Do you have fire departments, police departments, public education, public transit, infrastructure spending &amp; the military in the US? Ohh the US is socialist too. 
Putting people first. 
USERNAME_TERM Here's a thought... instead of spending millions of dollars sending our military to the border, shift to enforcing harsh fines against business owners who hire illegals. Establish thumbprint identification software for short-term work permits. Work with brown communities.

USERNAME_TERM Russia is a military superpower just like the US. The bottom line is they can do whatever they want just like the US. Until countries start spending much more on their own militaries to be able to fight back there is nothing we can do. Even if it is unjust and totally wrong 
Keep up the great work POTUS

What we are against is sending troops to the border spending $millions to sit there and not be able to do anything by law lol. Smoke and mirrors. Families traveling for 100s of miles is a real threat 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM I said “around 70%”. Sorry you took that so literally I didn’t have #s in front of me. Of course I was including QUERY_TERM and Medicare. They alone will comprise of 62% of total spending for 2019. QUERY_TERM will be around 3 times less than that. Again...”around” 
This is one of the reasons “We The People” must demand earmarks against our Defense Spending are voted down .. Military Strength is the USA’s biggest deterrent against “Enemies of the State” Don’t be fooled by the Dems! Keep America Strong  URL_TERM

Chief of Staff John Kelly asked the President to guess the salary of the nation’s highest ranking military officer. Trump said $5 million.  (It’s less than $200,00.)
I'll be spending my holiday without my daughter because there's no Public Safety in New Jersey and we don't have a MILITARY that protect MILITARY FAMILIES so I want 2thank you ALL I hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving with your FAMILY mines been affected by DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

RT USERNAME_TERM The Left: The govt spends so much money on the military that they could be spending on other things! 
These military men here act as if I’m in NDA or Police Academy!! Many of us go home with so many reactions and infections and we are paid N19500. I spent over 40k coming to this prison called NYSC CAMP and i don’t think I’m spending lesser going home 
In 2017 USA spent 590 BILLION dollars on QUERY_TERM but free college &amp; giving asylum to South American’s running from war is socialism  give me a fucking break
How much does the US military waste on reckless spending...ridiculous things like a $280 coffee mug 
USERNAME_TERM It’s resistance to universal health care and QUERY_TERM coupled with QUERY_TERM that will prevent change. America let capitalists have their way. No other developed country could afford to and so common sense took hold generations ago. Hard to see America changing. 
This is one clueless Congressional Rep. If the GOP can hand out trillions in tax cuts from our taxpayer pockets and expand QUERY_TERM by $165 billion over two years I s'pose we could feed the people. What an inane query you ninny.  URL_TERM
He thinks they have a 9-5 job with weekends &amp; holidays off.
Really sad that i might be spending my Thanksgiving without my other half because the Military doesnt care about its members or their families 
He says he loves the military then he does nothing to help those who served 
Happy Thanksgiving to all military women and men who are spending it  without the comfort of home and the solace of their families gathered around them in a safe space.  God bless you. Thank you for your service! 
It's just pictures of Presidents spending Thanksgiving dinner with the troops. What's the big deal?? Oh you mean trump?? They were all military too, they just dressed in "civies" . Military doesn't have to wear uniforms on Thanksgiving Day...try again Libtard!
USERNAME_TERM Unprecedented threat? If instead of spending millions bringing military to Mexican border, you set up processing centers to hear their petitions, you would not have this chaos. You’ve made these people even more desperate. Leading to violence?  Maybe. 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Haha Democrats are the worse thing possibly for the nation and what world - lol  u liberals aren’t going to stop Bitching and lying - Obama disrespected and hurt our military... dems cut QUERY_TERM ... cut vet (va) bills... all dems care about is votes.. gays and immigra

USERNAME_TERM I watched &amp; listened to the show in its entirety. You were wonderful &amp; I know the military were proud to talk with you. You expressed gratitude to all. Now I hear that the House may try to cut defense spending. I can’t believe it. Your loyal base is with you Mr President ️️
USERNAME_TERM A small group of mexican officers stoped the 300 unarmed migrants from reaching the border. Your president sent hundreds of military armed forces, spending millions of tax payers money, really?  USERNAME_TERM #StopWastingMoney #FocusOnRealProblems URL_TERM
wtf? 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM “What are they supposed to do here?” Easy answer; instead of spending millions to send our military down there for a political stunt, spend those millions on immigration attorneys, judges and a system to properly and quickly process these refugees for asylum! Fuck Trump!
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM it's hilarious that after spending $972 millions on its first ever audit, the #war department congratulated itself even when it FAILED the audit...
Something heavy on my heart...please remember not everyone will be spending Thanksgiving with their families tomorrow. Please pray for our men and women who are currently serving in the military, so that we can enjoy days like tomorrow️
Extremely thankful for the men and women in the military and first responders that won’t be spending thanksgiving with their families this year...you guys rock ️
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM But you all hate QUERY_TERM dont you? And condemn the yemen proxy war without knowing the wider implications. But you all love to bitch and complain while you clutch your pearls
Trump has added a shit ton of money to QUERY_TERM but can't - won't - support our vets.  Pay them! URL_TERM
We all benefit from a strong military! No deal should be made to fund it He gave libs 600 Billion  URL_TERM
my least favorite thing about today is the fact that isaac will be spending it alone. ️ we have only spent 1/4 Thanksgivings that we’ve been together.. with eachother.
thank you, my love. ️ URL_TERM
................lol but wait a min, I actually want to see this "space force" 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM  no just please explain essential QUERY_TERM in the 600 billion dollar range. Literally dying to here this
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Since you’d like to take care of this country first, let’s eliminate a large portion of our QUERY_TERM, and spending to go to florida every other day and we could definitely help a lot mire people! 
make sure you appreciate being with your family this thanksgiving! being away from mine during the holidays is the worst feeling. if the military has taught me anything, it's that we take too much for granted, especially little things like spending a few hours with the fam. 
Military took all my birthdays away turned 17 at MEPS swearing in , graduated basic on my 18th , MUTA 4 drill on my 19th , now my 20th I’m spending overseas 
did on Thanksgiving instead of spending time visiting with the military like previous presidents did.  ~~&gt;  URL_TERM
 RT if you think he should visit them! #Mexico URL_TERM
Fucking moron
Yes Fantastic  (sarcasm)…
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Oh yeah, because as we know, Republicans are big fans of holding police responsible for use of force, removing all corporate power from government, legalizing all drugs, slashing QUERY_TERM dramatically, etc. 
USERNAME_TERM This man is not even ashamed of splitting out shit for mouth.... how can govt be saying terrorist has weapons and drones more than the military,they are not spending billions on what they are using to kill people but govt spend billions to fight them 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM  essential QUERY_TERM.
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM  Spending trillions on QUERY_TERM to bomb poor brown people in other countries is not fiscally responsible. What is the point of “flipping districts blue” if you end up with people like this?
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM If USA QUERY_TERM is any indication of how good the USA is at estimating costs, it'll be way higher than that 
USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Don’t get me started on QUERY_TERM 
For the  #love  of our men &amp; women who are serving/have served in our #Military, never ever give this turkey a pardon!

USERNAME_TERM USERNAME_TERM Sigh. You and POTUS both need to learn how NATO works. There's an agreement for members to raise their spending on their own military defense to 2% GDP by 2024. They're on track to meet that. NATO isn't a country club that has membership dues.  URL_TERM
